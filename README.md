# Movie Data Cleaning and Formatting Project

This project focuses on cleaning and formatting a CSV file named "movies.csv" that contains raw, poorly structured data related to movies. The goal is to transform this unrefined data into a clean, organized, and usable dataset suitable for analysis, reporting, or integration with other applications.

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Dealing with raw and poorly formatted data is a common challenge in data analysis and management. The "movies.csv" dataset may contain issues such as missing values, inconsistent data types, and naming inconsistencies. The primary objective of this project is to address these challenges and produce a well-structured dataset.

### Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: We address data quality issues within the "movies.csv" dataset, including handling missing values and resolving inconsistencies using Python and data manipulation libraries.

- **Data Formatting**: The project includes tasks like string manipulation, renaming columns for clarity, and improving the overall readability of the dataset.

- **Documentation**: The code and workflow for data cleaning and formatting are documented with clear explanations and comments, making it easy to understand and replicate the process.
